## Git Champs
## Practice git commands
## Instructions
Add your first name to this list in the class.md file by making a pull request to my repo. It helped me a ton a while ago! The more I practice, the more I feel I can use git in my job / projects. I hope you all have fun! 

### Step 1
- Fork my repo
- Clone it to your computer as you practice on class.
- In the command line, cd into that folder and open the class.md file
- Add your name with an asterisk (*) like the one that's already in the list.
- SInce the best practices as a developer is to work on your local environment, you'll create your own feature branch in the command line. The purpose of having your own branch is make your own contributions to a team or test a new feature, then later be merged in with the master.

Tip: always do git status to check up on a working clean directory or the current changes to be commited, if any.

- In order to create your own branch, do:
    - You'll automatically switch into your own feature branch - *Note:* Make sure to replace 'Jenn' with your own first name.
```
git status
git checkout -b jenns-update
```
- Then check and commit changes
```
git status
git commit -m "Jenn contributes to git-champs"
```

- In order to push your own branch to github, do this command:

```
git push -u origin jenns-update
```
- -u means upstream and origin is our remote repo
